## Education
- M.S., Data Science | University of Houston - Clear Lake (_May 2023_)	 			        		
- B.S., Physics | University of Texas at Austin (_Aug 2019_)

## Work Experience
**Intern @ United States Securities and Exchange Commission (_September 2022 - Present_)**
- Developed a web scraper to collect and organize text data from the SEC website where the text may present as a PDF, TXT, HTML, or XML files
- Analyzed text using word clouds, readability metrics, and distribution tests such as normal distribution testing and Kolmogorov-Smirnov testing
- Optimized a probability calibrated ordinal NLP/ML model on imbalanced data that accurately classified text
- Evaluate model results by using the probabilities of a text being classified to each label to determine what the model learned when it classifies correctly, what it needs to learn when it classifies incorrectly, and what text it struggles with when the probabilities are all near equal
- Read scientific articles regarding state-of-the-art ordinal metrics for model evaluation and comparison then wrote these metrics in Python as they were not yet available in any python libraries
- Developed a webpage in JavaScript to generate a table of the NLP/ML model results in a human-readable form
- Hosted a static website using Amazon Web Services (AWS) Simple Storage Service (S3)
- Hosted my NLP/ML model using AWS Sagemaker Endpoint
- Developed an AWS Lambda function to allow stakeholders to retrieve the modelâ€™s text classification inference by selecting two parameters from a static websiteâ€™s dropdown menu
- Implemented AWS API Gateway to allow an AWS Lambda function to communicate with a front-end static website

- Understanding of the practices and processes used by a junior or associate data analyst in their day-to-day job
- Understand how to clean and organize data for analysis, and complete analysis and calculations using spreadsheets, SQL and R programming
- Learned key analytical skills (data cleaning, analysis, & visualization) and tools (spreadsheets, SQL, R programming, Tableau)
- Learned how to visualize and present data findings in dashboards, presentations and commonly used visualization platforms

## Research Experience
**Wolf Rayet Star Research	(_Sep 2017 - May 2019_)**  
Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship  
Undergraduate Researcher, Advisors: Prof. Edward L. Robinson, Prof. Cynthia S. Froning  
&emsp;Worked on a long series of wolf-rayet star image observations looking for rapid short-term flux variability or stellar pulsations that can be used to infer interior stellar properties for important sources of chemical enrichment within the interstellar medium.
