- Optimized a probability calibrated ordinal NLP/ML model on imbalanced data that accurately classified text
- Evaluate model results by using the probabilities of a text being classified to each label to determine what the model learned when it classifies correctly, what it needs to learn when it classifies incorrectly, and what text it struggles with when the probabilities are all near equal
- Read scientific articles regarding state-of-the-art ordinal metrics for model evaluation and comparison then wrote these metrics in Python as they were not yet available in any python libraries
- Developed a webpage in JavaScript to generate a table of the NLP/ML model results in a human-readable form
- Hosted a static website using Amazon Web Services (AWS) Simple Storage Service (S3)
- Hosted my NLP/ML model using AWS Sagemaker Endpoint
- Developed an AWS Lambda function to allow stakeholders to retrieve the model’s text classification inference by selecting two parameters from a static website’s dropdown menu
- Implemented AWS API Gateway to allow an AWS Lambda function to communicate with a front-end static website
